              Rolling Reactions is a project in the course DH2413 Advanced
              Graphics and Interactions at KTH, 2023. It is a single player VR
              experience where the user gets to explore a chemistry lab, from a
              wheelchair bound personâ€™s perspective. The player uses Vivo hand
              controllers to move around and to interact with the surroundings.

                      General education of what it is like to work in a lab,
                      packaged as a fun sandbox game. The lack of insight into
                      research environments, like laboratories, might make
                      research seem less like actual science and more like
                      something that is agreed upon by a select elite. This
                      could lead to a lack of trust for the scientific
                      community. By presenting a somewhat true to life
                      simulation of a laboratory, the users can experience and
                      explore the lab by themselves, and even engage in
                      dangerous experiments in a safe way.

                      A laboratory simulator where you get a first person
                      experience of lab work. You may get to pick from a number
                      of different substances and machines, and see what the
                      true to life result will be. You can choose to follow
                      instructions on actual laborations, like extracting
                      caffeine from tea, or if you prefer just mess around and
                      accidentally set the lab on fire with the sodium+water
                      reaction.

                One of the most challenging things has been making the
                wheelchair behave in a believable and intuitive way. Achieving
                this goal has taken countless hours. Then also avoiding making
                players cyber sick while using the wheelchair in VR has added
                another layer of challenge. While developing the wheelchair
                simulation, the initial approach was to use Unity's inbuilt
                WheelColliders. However, this did not work very well as they did
                not react realistically to pushing the wheelchair, and turning
                was often slow. The final system we settled on used HingeJoints
                for the wheels, as well as applying spring forces to the caster
                wheels to improve turning. A lot of time was spent on fine
                tuning parameters and testing the system to finally achieve a
                quite realistic simulation of a wheelchair.

                VR interaction was a big challenge. For the wheelchair we had to
                create a custom interaction system, which involved learning
                about VR input as well as mapping it to a physically realistic
                wheelchair controller. At the start of the project we used
                SteamVR for interaction, but we realised that it did not play
                well with Zibra Effects and frequently crashed. Therefore we had
                to migrate to the Unity XR Toolkit very late in the project,
                which added to the challenge as we had to learn a completely new
                interaction system.
